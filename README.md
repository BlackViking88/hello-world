# hello-world
A basic repository for tutorials

Hi, call me BlackViking88. I'm new to the github world, but have been tinkering with programming since Commodore Vic-20 days.  I don't currently have a favorite or goto (ha) programming language, but I know a little Java, I know a little C, I know a little BASIC, I know a little Javascript, and am thinking about jumping into Ruby.
